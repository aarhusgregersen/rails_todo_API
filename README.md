# Rails TODO API

I built this tutorial project in order to figure out how Rails API Endpoints actually work. 
Turns out they're surprisingly simple!

I followed this guide for the build: 
[https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-three ]

You should be able to just clone the repo and spin it up (most gems are versioned, so there should be almost 0 incompatability.)

For another build I would probably follow this slightly more simplistic approach:
